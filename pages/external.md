Depending on your research aims, data from community health centers (CHCs) with a hospital’s data can significantly enhance clinical research, population health initiatives, and care coordination. Community health centers often serve as primary care providers for underserved and high-risk populations, capturing critical outpatient data that may complement the inpatient and emergency department (ED) data from the hospital. Together, these datasets provide a more comprehensive picture of patients' care journeys and health outcomes.

The Research Data Warehouse has a mechanism for 

**Care Everywhere data is not permitted to be used for Research. The CDW-R does not provide these data in datasets, and study teams should take care not to use these data while conducting manual chart reviews.**

## Community Health Centers: OCHIN & Community Connect

The CDW-R has access to data from the following CHCs: Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, Codman Square, DotHouse, Greater Roslindale, Mattapan Community, South Boston, South End, Upham’s Corner. 
**We do not have access to East Boston.**
 

The BMC/BUMC IRB also has guidance for submitting INSPIR applications for studies that include collaboration with/data from CHCs: https://www.bumc.bu.edu/irb/submission-requirements/special-submission-requirements/research-with-community-health-centers-chcs/  

### Accessing
Permission to access data for research is required from each Boston HealthNet CHC; this policy includes getting permission from each CHC to access simple aggregate counts. Boston HealthNet has a centralized Project Request Form to request access: https://www.bu.edu/ctsi/community-engagement/boston-healthnet-bhn/
