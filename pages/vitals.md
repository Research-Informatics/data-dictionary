Vital signs data provides fundamental insights into patient health and physiological status, making it a critical component of clinical research. Captured in both inpatient and outpatient care settings, vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature offer real-time indicators of a patientâ€™s well-being and can be used to monitor trends, detect abnormalities, and evaluate the impact of interventions.

In the inpatient setting, vital signs are often recorded at high frequency, especially in critical care scenarios, offering granular insights into acute health events. In the outpatient setting, vital signs are typically captured during routine visits, providing a snapshot of the patient's condition over time and aiding in chronic disease management.
