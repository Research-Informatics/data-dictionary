Encounter and utilization data provide a vital foundation for understanding how patients interact with the healthcare system across various care settings. These data types capture detailed information about the nature, frequency, and outcomes of patient visits, making them critical for research focused on healthcare delivery, resource allocation, and patient outcomes. Encounter data encompass diverse settings such as outpatient visits (including telemedicine), inpatient admissions, emergency department (ED) encounters, and surgical procedures.


When using encounters and utilization data, it is essential to align your data request with your research question. Consider which types of utilization are relevant to your study and how these encounters fit into the patientâ€™s flow of care. Additionally, reflect on the sequence of care. Are patients moving between outpatient visits, ED encounters, and inpatient stays? Understanding this flow helps identify which encounters are necessary for your analysis. Some studies may need encounters, but it's more common to require specific utilization (e.g. office visits with the endo clinic). 

The CDW-R provides standard encounter and utilization fields, as outlined below. Be explicit if additional data points are required to address your study question effectively. **Part II data are discussed further in the special considerations section.**
