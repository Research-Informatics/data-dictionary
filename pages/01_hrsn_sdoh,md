## Health Related Social Needs and Social Determinants of Health
This resource describes social determinants of health (SDOH), health-related social needs, and other data fields relevant to health equity research that are available from the CDW for Research â€“ including data definitions, descriptions, sources, and limitations.

Given the nature of SDOH data, available data fields are dynamic and often evolve in various clinical and data systems. Reach out to the cdw@bmc.org with questions.

The document outlines data available in Epic. If you are interested in SDOH data prior to Epic implementation (prior to June 2015), e-mail our team at cdw@bmc.org to discuss options for data available from legacy systems.
