## Internal Classifications & Categorizations
The Research Data and Informatics team has developed a bespoke research data warehouse tailored to meet the unique needs of our hospital's research community. This system goes beyond implementing standard best practicesâ€”it enhances and refines them to align with our institution's research goals. By integrating carefully designed classifications, taxonomies, and ontologies, we provide a robust framework for organizing and understanding complex datasets, enabling researchers to navigate and utilize data more effectively.

Through this structured approach, we aim to support high-quality research, facilitate meaningful insights, and drive innovation in patient care and beyond.
