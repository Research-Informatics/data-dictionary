Depending on your research aims, data from community health centers (CHCs) with a hospital’s data can significantly enhance clinical research, population health initiatives, and care coordination. Community health centers often serve as primary care providers for underserved and high-risk populations, capturing critical outpatient data that may complement the inpatient and emergency department (ED) data from the hospital. Together, these datasets provide a more comprehensive picture of patients' care journeys and health outcomes.

The Research Data Warehouse has a mechanism for 

**Per Hospital system contacts, Care Everywhere data is not permitted to be used for Research. That is, you are not allowed to access EMR components from other institutions by using Care Everywhere. These data are not in the Data Warehouse and will thus not be provisioned in your CDW-R data set, and you cannot capture them as part of a manual chart review for research purposes. If any data from another institution are accessed, whether it be by somebody on the team or outside the team, that institution is engaged in research and would have to either get their own IRB review or be added via a reliance agreement. Whether or not somebody is credentialed/affiliated at another institution in addition to BMC does not alter the requirements above. Contact BMC Research Legal and the IRB with questions.**

The CDW-R has access to data from the following CHCs: 
* Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program
* Codman Square
* DotHouse
* Greater Roslindale
* Mattapan Community
* South Boston
* South End
* Upham’s Corner.

The BMC/BUMC IRB also has [guidance](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/irb/submission-requirements/special-submission-requirements/research-with-community-health-centers-chcs/ "IRB CHC Information") for submitting INSPIR applications for studies that include collaboration with/data from CHCs.

### Accessing
Permission to access data for research is required from each Boston HealthNet CHC; this policy includes getting permission from each CHC to access simple aggregate counts. Boston HealthNet has a centralized Project Request [Form](https://www.bu.edu/ctsi/community-engagement/boston-healthnet-bhn/ "BHN Form") to request access:
