The Research Data & Informatics team oversees data governance and ensures compliance for using data for research. These efforts and frameworks provide the necessary policies, processes, and safeguards to ensure data integrity, security, and ethical use in research. 
<br>_Research data governance_ dictates how data are managed appropriately and responsibly. Such focuses primarily on data ownership, stewardship, access permissions, data quality, and lifecycle management.
<br>_Research data compliance_ ensures we are adhering to laws, regulations, and institutional policies. Such focuses primarily on HIPAA, IRB and data use agreements. 


To align with hospital policy, all clinical data used for research must be sourced through the Clinical Data Warehouse for Research (CDW-R) team. This centralized approach ensures that:
* Data aligns with IRB determination. 
* Institutional guidelines, including data use agreements and IRB approvals, are met.
* Researchers have access to high-quality, validated data for their studies.
