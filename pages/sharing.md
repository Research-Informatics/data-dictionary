## Sharing Clinical Data Outside of BMC for Research Purposes

This guide explains the process and requirements for sharing clinical data with external entities for research purposes. At BMC, protecting patient data is a top priority, governed by institutional policies, state and federal laws, and our commitment to equitable care. Below, we provide an overview of the key considerations and steps for researchers.

### Legal and Regulatory Background

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) establishes rules designed to protect sensitive health information. A central component is the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 C.F.R. Parts 160.162 and 164) enacted in 2002, which applies to Covered Entities like BMC and their Business Associates. 

### What is Protected Health Information (PHI)?
PHI includes any individually identifiable health information about an individual’s:
- Past, present, or future physical or mental health condition.
- Treatment for a condition.
- Payment for healthcare services.

PHI is subject to strict rules for **Use** (e.g., sharing, analyzing) and **Disclosure** (e.g., releasing, transferring). Typically, a valid **Authorization** from the patient is required.

### Requirements for Authorization
A valid HIPAA Authorization must:
- Clearly describe the information to be used or shared.
- Identify who is requesting the data and who will receive it.
- Specify the purpose of the use or disclosure.
- Include an expiration date or event.
- Be signed and dated by the individual.
- Acknowledge the individual’s rights (e.g., to revoke the authorization).

For prospective research, BMC incorporates these requirements into the **Informed Consent Form (ICF)** for study enrollment.

### Options for Using or Sharing PHI Without Authorization
In cases where information was not collected for research purposes, or if the authorization otherwise fails to identify the specific purpose of a proposed Disclosure, there are limited avenues available for using or disclosing PHI:

If the **use or disclosure is for research purposes**, BMC may proceed if: 
  * the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approves a waiver of Authorization;
  * the PHI will be reviewed internally for the purpose of preparing a research protocol; or
  * the Use or Disclosure is limited to information on decedents.
**De-Identification**: ALL identifiers are removed such that the risk of re-identification is very small—and the information therefore no longer constitutes PHI; 
**Data Use Agreement (DUA)**: For sharing a **Limited Data Set** (e.g., data with most identifiers removed but retaining dates and broad geographic information). 

> **Note**: A DUA outlines permitted uses of the data and ensures compliance with regulations.

### BMC’s Institutional Policies
At BMC, any transfer of data derived from a human subject is documented, even if the data is de-identified. This ensures:
* Clear tracking of who possesses BMC data.
* Transparency about what data were shared and for what purpose.

### How to Share Data
For researchers looking to share data externally:
1. **Contact the DUA team**: [Email us](mailto:DUA.MTARequest@bmc.org) for guidance.
2. **Submit an [Intake Questionnaire](https://hub.bmc.org/system/files/docs/2024-12/BMC_MTA-DUA_Intake_Questionnaire_Dec.%202024.pdf "DUA Intake")**: Initiate the agreement process. Many transfers can be documented quickly and easily.

By following these guidelines, researchers can ensure compliance with legal and institutional requirements while supporting the responsible and ethical use of clinical data in research.
